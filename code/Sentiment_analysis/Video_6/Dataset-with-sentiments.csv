RBumgq5yVrA,UgyLT9iLH4_1QnrHim94AaABAg,so  i  owe  so  much  to  this  song  mr  rosenberg    and  i  thank  you  so  very    very  much  for  writing  this  amazing  track  which  has  become  a  bit  of  a  repetitive  theme  in  my  adult  life    long  ago  when  i  saw  moonbeams  come  out  of  piles  of  shit    an  example  of  this  being  my  ex  husband    i  married  somebody  who  i  thought  had  the  potential  to  grow  into  a  decent  human  being    but  sadly    did  not    and  after  many  many  years  of  suffering  and  disrespect    i  began  to  question  whether  i  could  carry  on  in  the  relationship  despite  2  amazingly  clever  and  handsome  sons  having  been  born      your  song    let  her  go    came  on  the  radio  and  the  floodgates  opened      they  literally  did  not  want  to  stop    i  repeated  the  song  at  least  5  times    knowing  very  well  the  first  time  it  came  on    that  your  lyrics  had  spoken  to  me      my  marriage  was  over  because  this  man  would  never  ever    appreciate  me  until  i  left  him    and  so  your  song  became  poignant  in  that  moment  for  that  reason    a  year  later    free  and  happy  i  met  the  most  wonderful  man      we  clicked  instantly  and  i  fell  in  love    we  were  inseperable  and  i  finally  was  loved  how  i  wanted  to  be    he  died  sadly  in  his  sleep  after  we  were  together  6  months    he  suffered  with  sleep  apnea  and  stopped  breathing    i  moved  my  children  and  myself  back  to  the  uk  heartbroken    to  be  near  to  my  family  and  i  started  my  life  again  alone    6  months  after  ian  died    i  happened  to  put  this  song  onto  you  tube  via  my  computer  and  my  jaw  dropped  open              the  video  for  this  song  was  you    yet  my  brain  went  into  complete  shock      it  was  literally  like  watching  ian  through  the  tv        your  face  looked  exactly  like  ian's    your  clothes    your  stature    your  stance    you  both  played  guitar      i  never  even  knew  that  'passenger'  was  just  a  solo  artist    yourself          i  sat  on  the

RBumgq5yVrA,UgwGS-6NzZANP0sBoEh4AaABAg,i  have  a  story    for  anyone  that  wants  to  hear  it    this  is  about  my  best  friend  and  massive  lifelong  crush    let's  call  my  friend    h        so    we  met  in  2nd  grade  when  she  moved  to  my  school    in  kentucky    from  hawaii    at  the  time  i  had  a  different  friend    let's  call  her    c      so    me  and  c  had  been  friends  since  kindergarten    i  knew  that  c  was  going  to  go  into  homeschooling  at  the  end  of  the  year    so  i  was  feeling  really  sad  and  tried  to  make  some  new  friends    at  first  i  hated  h  because  i  thought  she  was  trying  to  steal  c  from  me    but  after  a  while  me    c    and  h  became  a  group    as  it  neared  the  end  of  the  year    i  met  this  random  boy    we  will  call  him    b      so    when  i  met  b  i  didn't  know  what  to  think  because  i  had  only  had  female  friends  before  this    i  started  to  develop  feelings  for  b    b  didn't  like  my  other  friends    so  i  wasn't  sure  how  to  feel  or  what  to  do  since  i  had  to  choose  between  b    who  i  fell  really  hard  for      or  c  and  h    it  was  the  end  of  second  grade    and  me  and  h  said  our  last  goodbyes  to  c    we  never  saw  c  again    in  3rd  grade    ms  and  h  were  in  different  classes    me  and  b  were  in  the  same  class  again    me  and  b  had  other  friends    which  aren't  important  enough  to  name      and  at  this  point  i  had  h    and  me  and  b's  friend  group    b  hated  h    i  ended  up  telling  h  about  my  feelings  for  b    then  i  told  a  few  other  people    as  expected    b  found  out    b  started  to  drift  away  from  me    and  those  other  friends  followed    i  tried  to  talk  to  b  but  he  didn't  want  anything  to  do  with  me    by  the  end  of  the  year    all  i  had  was  h    then  the  year  ended    when  4th  grade  started    i  was  still  heartbroken  over  b    b  thought  i  was  weird  and  hated  me  at  this  point    h  told  me  she  had  something  to  tell  me    h  told  me  that  she  was  moving  schools  and  probably  wouldn't  be  seeing  me  in  5th  grade    i  was  heartbroken    h  was  all  i  had    and  we  still  talked  about  c  sometimes    and  finding  c    it  was  the  end  of  the  fourth  grade  year    me  and  h  said  our  final  goodbyes    and  i  was  on  my  own    when  5th  grade  started    i  found  out  that  b  was  going  to  the  same  middle  school  as  me    to  be  honest    at  this  point  i  was  pretty  much  a  stalker    i  could  understand  why  he  would  hate  me  now    because  i  started  to  be  obsessive    but    you  know    first  loves    amirite    but  seriously    i  was  so  excited    over  the  years  everyone  at  my  elementary  had  found  out  about  my  crush    and  since  middle  school  was  starting    it  would  be  a  secret  again    right    yep    too  much  of  a  secret    i  did  my  whole  sixth  grade  year  virtual  and  thought  of  it  as  the  perfect  opportunity  to  escape  my  feelings  for  b    nope    actually    more  of  a  chance  to  embrace  them    i  know  this  sounds  dumb    but  i  would  just  stare  at  his  black  zoom  box  with  his  name    goofy  smile  on  my  face      just  remembering    over  the  years  i  had  faked  so  many  crushes  to  try  and  get  away  from  this  one    and  i  was  just  thinking  how  bad  of  a  stalker  i  was  to  b    he  was  introvert    and  i  am    and  have  always  been    extrovert    to  try  and  distract  myself  from  this  crush    i  emailed  my  old  friend    h    i  didn't  know  if  that  email  even  worked  anymore    but  surprise    i  got  an  email  back    she  told  me  her  discord    and  i  told  her  mine    we  stayed  in  contact  ever  since    now    i  had  another  problem    i  had  an  online  friend    e    who  introduced  me  to  her  online  friend    r    me  and  e  didn't  really  contact  anymore    and  me  and  r  became  closer    eventually    i  caught  feelings  for  r  so  i  confessed  to  her    she  said  she  liked  me    too    and  i  thought  i  escaped    i  introduced  h  to  r  and  r  hated  h    r  brainwashed  me  into  thinking  h  didn't  care  about  me    it  was  just  me  and  r  now    but  at  the  end  of  my  6th  grade  year  i  found  out  i  needed  to  go  to  summer  school    i  got  my  phone  taken  until  i  finished  it      mind  you    me  and  r  had  made  plans  to  literally  live  together  and  get  married  in  the  future  btw    by  this  time  i  had  forgotten  about  b    i  was  in  summer  school    doing  my  work    yk    as  it  goes    when  i  finished    though    everything  changed    i  went  to  text  r  and  tell  her  i  was  done    but  what  i  opened  her  contact  to  was  crushing      i  got  a  girlfriend  2  weeks  ago  and  i  was  scared  to  tell  you  so  i  dont  have  a  crush  on  you  anymore      that's  it    we  got  into  a  massive  argument    i  ended  up  cutting  off  all  contact  with  her    i  was  alone  again    everything  had  gotten  so  bad    i  started  thinking  about  b  again    how  had  an  innocent  little  childhood  crush  turned  into  this    i  was  so  mad  at  myself  for  letting  it  get  this  out  of  control    i  didn't  like  his  as  much    but  memories    you  know      by  the  start  of  7th  grade    i  had  stopped  thinking  about  him    my  friendship  with  h  had  been  revived    but  h  wasn't  the  same    sweet    loving  soul    h  is  now  just  kinda  depressed    i'm  sure    h  went  to  visit  her  grandma  in  sc  right  as  covid  started  and  is  now  stuck  with  her    so  now  lives  there    i'm  not  the  same  either    though    so  i  can't  complain    i  have  new  friendships  now    and  my  life  is  starting  to  look  up    i'm  homeschooled    but  in  the  time  that  i  was  going  to    in  person    i  made  a  decent

 crush  on  b    and  i  know  this  sounds  stupid    but  it  kinda  saved  me    because  obsessing  over  someone  who  you  haven't  spoken  to  in  4  years  isn't  healthy    anyways    7th

one  day    because  i  can  tell  you  have  some  awesome  music  taste        you  re  such  a  beautiful  human  being  and  worth  and  enough    i  hope  you  know  that  you  do  only  need  yourself  to  be  happy    i  know  society  build  up  the  standard  that  whenever  you  re  alone  you  re  not  living  a  happy  live    but  in  fact  that  is  not  true    if  you  start  to  realize  that  you  actually  deserve  all  the  good  things  happening  to  you    you  will  treat  yourself  a  lot    nicer    i  hope  you  let  yourself  rest    don  t  beat  yourself  up  over  past  mistakes    over  regret    and  over  everything  your  mind  wants  to  destroy  you    i  wish  i  could  remove  all  those  demons  inside  of  your  head  because  you  deserve  to  feel  happy    if  you  ever  feel  lonely  then  watch  the  sky    because  you  know    someone    at  the  same  time  is  watching  the  sky  too    maybe  feeling  the  same  way  i  am  glad  you  exist  and  i  hope  you  won  t  ever  remove  your  own  spot  in  this  world    maybe  you  don  t  feel  like  you  belong  here  but    angel    then  build  your  home  here    i  don  t  want  you  to  leave  this  world  unhappy    i  want  you  to  live  every  little  second    i  want  you  to  feel  alive    i  don  t  want  you  to  see  yourself  just  existing    you  deserve  it    whatever  happened    it  s  not  your  fault    the  demons  in  your  head  recognize  that  you  have  a  beautiful  heart    they  want  to  take  it  because  they  have  never  seen  such  beautiful  heart  as  yours    so  why  let  them  win  over  you        you  re  not  selfish  for  isolating  yourself    but  you  deserve  to  talk  to  someone    if  you  re  reading  this  than  please  never  forget  to  breath  and  smile        don  t  live  up  to  other  standards    it  s  your  story  and  not  theirs          life  for  those  who  couldn  t    smile  for  those  who

      it  hurts  me  to  see  you  re  in  pain        you  deserve  so  much  better  love    don  t  let  your  emotions  control  you    don  t  let  them  get  the  best  of  you        i  love  you    i  love  you  i  love  you  i  love  you  i  love  you  please  don  t  go      i  am  sorry  that  no  one  is  hearing  you    i  am  sorry  no  one  is  noticing  that  you  have  lost  yourself    i  wish  i  could  take  your  pain  away    it  hurts  me  to  see  the  pain  in  your  eyes      i  love  you  trough  my  words  and  i  mean  it    i  just  want  you  to  stay    hold  on  a  little  longer  okay    please    for  me          i  hope  you  have  an  awesome  day    morning    evening    night        if  it  s  night  for  you    go  to  sleep    i  know  it  s

such  sad  music    i  know  it  s  impossible  to  have  a  good  day  with  such  mindset  but  take  baby  steps    start  by  drinking  two  cups  of  water  in  the  morning  and  so  on      you  will  start  building  little  healthy  habits        if  it  s  evening  for  you    you  re  probably  overwhelmed  and  stressed    i  want  you  to  know  it  s  okay  to  feel  the  way  you  feel    you  don  t  need  to  be  scared    of  course  you  re  overwhelmed  or  stressed    i  mean  who  wouldn  t    but  it  s  important  to  know  that  when  you  feel  that  way  you  should  do  a  little  self  care    such  as  taking  a  bath  for  example    you  deserve  to  feel  at  ease  and  relaxed        and  if  you  are  somewhere  in  between  i  hope  you  know  that  you  re  stronger  than  you  think    i  know  you  will  make  it            all  i  want  for  you  is  to  stay  and  feel  alive        now  wipe  those  tears  away  and  smile  for  me    you  really  don  t  know  much  a  smile  can  brighten  someone  s  day    do  you    i  hope  one  day  yours  will  become  a  genuine  one  where  you  don  t  need  to  fake  it  anymore    because  i  can  t  say  this  enough    you  deserve  a  good  smile  and  to  feel  alive    you  re  worth  more  than  every  fucking  cent  in  this  world      i  need  you  here  with  me
