and  they  make  it  back  to  their  own  planet  safely    at  the  next  buildup      the  one  with  the  strong  beat  behind  it    we  see  the  same  kid    grown  up    working  to  remake  the  friend  he'd  lost  so  many  years  ago    as  he's  working    he  gets  flashbacks  to  the  pod  and  the  explosion    after  years  and  years  of  studying  and  training  and  working  his  way  up  the  ranks    he  still  hasn't  let  go  of  that  dream    he  grows  up    gets  a  family    becomes  a  father    but  still  wants  to  recreate  something  he'd  lost    deep  down    he  knows  he  shouldn't    and  that  the  ai  died    for    him    not  because  of  him    he  blames  himself  for  the  death    and  wants  to  apologize    he  successfully  remakes  the  ai    and    when  it  stands  before  him    he  breaks  down    the  memories  come  rushing  back    everything  from  their  lives  together  as  children    to  his  friend  dying  the  first  time    the  second    and  now  being  born  again      why  couldn't  i  just  let  you  die      the  song  ends  with  the  kid    now  a  scientist    going  home  to  be  with  his

W2TE0DjdNqI,UgxIljA4BBtaHvdf0ZZ4AaABAg,in  august  of  2009    my  family  and  i  adopted  a  black  lab  husky  cross  dog    i  was  6  at  the  time    and  am  now  18    he  was  3  years  old  at  the  time  of  adoption    he  was  the  best  pet    and  more  importantly    the  best  friend  i  ever  could  have  asked  for    i  grew  up  with  him  for  two  thirds  of  my  life    he  started  out  with  almost  no  white  hairs  at  all    only  a  white  patch  on  his  chest  and  some  white  fur  on  the  bottoms  of  his  paws    12  years  later    he  had  a  lot  more  white  hairs    but  still  was  mostly  black  haired    he  even  had  a  little  part  on  his  upper  lip  that  made  it  look  like  he  had  a  moustache    whenever  i  felt  sad  or  alone    he  was  always  someone  i  could  go  to  for  comfort    he  loved  to  be  pet    and  i  made  sure  to  spend  as  much  time  as  i  could  with  him  recently    he  used  to  be  so  energetic    always  up  and  about    ready  to  do  something    he  loved  to  go  for  rides  in  the  car    even  to  the  point  where  if  someone  spoke  the  word    ride      his  little  black  ears  would  perk  up    and  he  would  smile    ready  to  go    same  thing  with  walks    he  loved  to  walk  around  town    but  over  the  past  few  years    he  began  to  have  much  less  energy    up  until  maybe  a  month  ago  however    he  was  always  ready  to  go  for  a  walk    even  in  the  winter    his  health  began  to  decline  exponentially  over  the  past  one  to  two  years    and  for  the  past  year    found  it  harder  and  harder  to  get  up  and  walk    up  to  a  week  ago    he  could  hardly  even  walk  at  all    almost  falling  over  constantly  due  to  his  hind  legs  giving  out    he  was  in  a  lot  of  pain  for  a  while    the  pain  only  getting  worse  and  worse  over  time    every  time  i  would  go  into  the  kitchen  to  make  food    he  was  always  there    watching  me  with  beady    puppy  dog  eyes    i  almost  always  gave  him  a  little  treat    whether  it  be  some  cheese    some  sandwich  meat    or  a  dog  treat    every  time  we  ordered  food    he  was  always  there  to  greet  the  delivery  driver    a  couple  days  ago    he  couldn't  even  get  up  at  all    but  when  we  ordered  pizza  just  two  days  ago    he  managed  to  find  the  energy  to  get  up  and  meet  the  delivery  guy      he  was  the  friendliest  dog  too    he  never  bit  anybody    but  was  always  wagging  his  tail    happy  to  see  someone  new    he  loved  to  meet  new  people    and  loved  seeing  the  same  people  again  even  more      on  october  26th    2021    raider  took  a  ride  in  the  car  for  the  last  time  to  the  vet    surrounded  by  the  people  that  loved  him    he  closed  his  eyes    and  had  moved  on  from  the  mortal  realm    he  is  no  longer  in  any  pain    he's  somewhere  far  better  now    probably  chasing  some  birds  or  squirrels  like  he  had  done  in  his  youth    you  will  forever  be  missed  buddy      today    i  played  this  song  in  beat  saber  on  expert  difficulty  in  honor  of  him    and  i  hope  to  full  combo  the  song  on  expert    difficulty    if  i  ever  manage  to  do  so    i  will

   fires  tore  through  forests  and  demolished  farms    the  roads  were  littered  with  animal  carcasses    sometimes  even  humans        humanity  was  forced  to  leave    forced  to  live  in  space  for  hundreds  of  years    billions  were  left  behind  to  die  on  earth    only  the  lucky  ones  were  able  to  escape  into  space    but  really    nobody  was  lucky  in  the

grabbing  her  by  each  arm    they  coaxed  her  from  the  room    ignoring  her  cries  of  desperation    the  crowd  was  deathly  silent          it  has  been  settled    daniel  farewall  will  go  to  earth  this  coming  full  moon              the  second  week  of  october  had  passed  and  the  moon  was  shining  through  the  space  station  windows    daniel  was  getting  ready  in  the  boarding  deck  after  he  had  said  his  goodbyes  to  his  friends  and  family    he  felt  quite  honored  to  have  been  chosen  for  this  position    random  people  would  pat  his  shoulder  or  give  a  slight  nod  in  his  direction  as  he  passed  by    he  didn  t  understand  why  everyone  had  been  so  emotional  saying  goodbye    he  was  coming  back    wasn  t  he      as  the  general  handed  him  his  instructions  for  when  he  arrived  on  earth    he  adjusted  daniel  s  helmet  on  his  head      try  to  get  as  much  information  as  you  can      the  general  said      daniel  nodded    then  said      should  i  bring  back  earth  samples    maybe  i  could  collect  some  dirt    or  maybe  a  plant    if  there  are  any        the  general  laughed  bitterly        bring  back      there  s  no  way  back  up  from  the  transport  pod    farewall          what  do  you  mean          you  re  staying  down  there          for  how  long          however  long  it  takes  for  you  to  die    days    hours    or  seconds    who  knows        daniel  s  eyes  widened  as  he  took  a  step  back  in  surprise      i  don  t  understand    sir    this  wasn  t  part  of  my  training        the  general  gripped  his  shoulder  and  pulled  him  toward  two  metal  doors  that  slid  open  when  they  got  near      don  t  forget  to  keep  us  updated    you  have  that  intercom  in  your  suit  for  a  reason        before  daniel  could  reply    he  was  pushed  into  the  transport  pod  and  the  doors  closed  behind  him    he  stood    unmoving    for  a  moment    his  thoughts  running  through  his  brain    he  turned  to  the  metal  doors  and  pounded  his  fists  on  them        please  let  me  out    anyone      he  cried    but  got  no  response      after  a  minute  of  silence    he  let  out  a  sigh  and  sat  down  in  the  fresh  leather  chair  in  the  center  of  the  pod    he  ran  his  fingers  across  the  dashboard    tapping  buttons  and  flicking  switches  with  blurry  eyesight  until  the  pod  began  to  rumble    daniel  clenched  the  armrests  and  pressed  himself  into  the  back  of  his  chair    the  transport  pod  slowly  detached  from  the  space  station    blinking  his  watery  eyes  away    daniel  braced  himself  for  what  was  about  to  come              a  sharp  pain  in  daniel  s  head  and  the  smell  of  smoke  woke  him    ever  so  slightly    he  regained  his  vision    his  head  was  rested  across  the  dashboard  of  the  pod    his  body  barely  hanging  onto  the  edge  of  the  chair    wires  had  fallen  from  the  roof    the  front  window  was  cracked  and  glass  was  scattered  everywhere    once  he  became  aware  of  the  situation    he  wondered  how  he  had  survived    daniel  quickly  realized  that  something  was  dripping  down  his  uncovered  forehead    he  looked  around  the  pod  for  his  helmet  and  found  it  lying  in  the  back    broken  and  splattered  with  thick  red  liquid        he  wiped  his  forehead  and  looked  at  his  hand    he  let  out  a  little  yelp  of  surprise    seeing  that  his  hand  was  completely  drenched  in  blood    daniel  quickly  stood  up  and  leaned  against  the  wall    he  pried  open  the  door  and  squinted  as  the  harsh  sunlight  hit  his  face      earth  wasn  t  how  daniel  imagined  it    the  air  was  thick  and  cloudy    the  sky  was  a  deathly  crimson  color  and  the  sun  looked  huge    bigger  than  it  ever  had  from  the  space  station    daniel  figured  whatever  was  on  the  ground  was  once  grass    but  it  didn  t  look  like  the  grass  in  the  station  s  greenhouse    it  was  shriveled  and  dry  and  the  ground  underneath  it  was  cracked  and  dusty    he  seemed  to  have  landed  in  an  open  field    but  he  could  see  the  outline  of  barren  trees  in  the  distance    everything  seemed  so  different  then  what  daniel  had  seen  in  pictures    but  for  some  reason    he  couldn  t  help  but  smile        he  raised  his  finger  to  tap  the  intercom  button  on  his  suit    but  then  stopped    the  government  sent  him  here  to  die  just  so  they  could  get  some  information  about  earth    they  knew  earth  was  still  dangerous        his  smile  disappeared  quickly  and  he  began  to  slowly  walk  away  from  the  pod  and  towards  the  trees    he  reached  the  top  of  a  small  hill  and  discovered  a  measly  broken  down  hut  on  the  other  side      as  the  sun  scorched  his  skin  and  head  pounding    he  descended  the  hill  and  made  his  way  towards  it        when  daniel  reached  for  the  door  handle    the  door  completely  fell  off  its  hinges  and  into  the  hut    dust  flew  up  from  every  corner  of  the  one  room  house    sending  daniel  into  a  coughing  fit  and  a  sharp  pain  to  his  forehead    inside  the  hut    there  was  a  little  cot  in  the  corner  and  a  desk  beside  it    mold  had  taken  over  almost  every  part  of  the  floor  and  parts  of  the  walls        daniel  stepped  inside  and  sat  down  on  the  old  cot    he  pulled  open  a  few  drawers  in  the  desk  until  he  found  something        a  small    rectangular  object  was  placed  in  the  very  back  of  the  bottom  drawer    he  gently  picked  it  up  and  held  it  close  to  his  face    blinking  sweat  and  blood  off  his  eyelashes    there  was  a  piece  of  tape  stuck  to  it    and  written  on  the  tape  were  the  words    goodbye  to  a  world      he  studied  the  six  buttons  on  the  object    recognizing  the  symbols    he  pressed  the  button  that  had  a  triangle  on  it    assuming  it  was  the    play    button    as  soon  as  he  pressed  it    two  little  wheels  started  to  turn  inside  and  a  voice  came  from  the  device          thank  you    i  ll  say  goodbye  soon      it  was  a  woman    her  voice  sounded  shaky      though  it's  the  end  of  the  world    don  t  blame  yourself        the  woman  stopped  speaking  for  a  moment  to  take  a  strangled  breath          and  if  it's  true    i  will  surround  you  and  give  life  to  a  world  that  s  our  own          the  recording  ended  too  soon    daniel  hugged  it  to  his  chest  and  sighed    he  wondered  how  long  the  device  had  been  sitting  in  the  hut    he  wiped  some  blood  off  of  his  neck  and  pressed  play  again    this  time    the  women  s  voice  was  slightly  staticy        he  listened  to  the  recording  again      then  a  fourth  time      daniel  had  lost  count  of  how  many  times  he  replayed  the  woman  s  voice    when  he  pressed  the  play  button  again    he  could  no  longer  make  out  her  words    but  he  knew  them    the  voice  no  longer  sounded  like  a  woman    it  was  staticy  and  distorted    like  a  robot  s  voice        daniel  tried  to  press  play    but  nothing  happened    he  clenched  the  recorder  in  his  hand  and  stood  up  abruptly    throwing  it  against  the  wall  in  a  fit  of  anger    the  recorder  shattered  into  pieces    shards  of  plastic  flying  across  the  room        he  sighed    falling  to  his  knees    images  of  his  family    friends    and  their  goodbyes  flickered  through  his  mind    he  wanted  to  go  back        but  he  couldn  t        he  brought  his  hands  up  to  his  face  and  clutched  his  head    he  heard  the  sound  of  his  hair  squish  when  he  touched  it    it  was  blood              daniel  collapsed  onto  the  floor    overcome  with  exhaustion    he  decided  to  rest    with  the  woman  s  voice  replaying  in  his  head    his  eyes  closed  as  he  muttered  her  words        thank  you  for  taking  time  in  reading  this      for  a  less  sad  story  lmao  here      hey  guys  we're  a  team  right          no    we're  a  clan        nah    we're  a  family

W2TE0DjdNqI,Ugwc7A8VA8kYx1PxOi94AaABAg,for  a  song  about  losing  someone    there's  something  deeply  relieving  about  listening  to  this  song    maybe  it's  the  fact  that  by  listening  to  it    it's  easier  to  mourn        to  cry  and  let  out  the  pain      because  i  am  saying  all  this    i'll  admit  that  i  have  my  woes  like  anyone  and  everyone    nobody  asked  me  to  type  them  out    just  my  conscience    the  world  i  had  to  say  goodbye  to  was  this  marvelous  individual        someone  i  not  only  fell  for  at  first  sight    but  fell  for  head  over  heels  and  back  around  again    i  was  overwhelmed  by  the  relatively  unconditional  feelings  i  felt  for  them    call  me  a  desperate  simp    i  don't  care    i  don't  feel  love  anymore      and  because  of  this        i  accidentally  overwhelmed  them  by  expressing  myself  the  only  way  i  know  how    with  words    they  weren't  much  of  a  reader    much  to  my  demise    and  my  paragraphs  and  poems  thus  went  overlooked      i  felt  that  i  needed  them  like  i  needed  air  and  sustenance    i  wanted  to  feel  the  full  embrace  of  completion    not  just  the  tickling  warmth  in  my  beating  heart    i'd  sell  my  soul  to  the  devil  for  them    i'd  lay  down  my  life  for  them    i'd  do  anything  for  them        it  pains  me  a  great  deal  to  admit  that  i  still  feel  this  way  for  them    that  i  can't  get  over  them  and  the  tremendous  impact  they've  had  on  my  life    i  soon  had  to  cut  ties  with  immense  reluctance  because  i  stopped  believing  that  i  could  be  patient    because  i  couldn't  be  patient  for  the  answer  of    i  like  you  a  lot  too    i'd  be  happy  to  date  you  to  see  how  it  goes    or    your  emotions  are  getting  out  of  hand    i  don't  know  how  to  feel    but  i  think  it'd  be  better  if  you  go  before  you  hurt  yourself      i  tried  contacting  them  again    at  least  with  the  help  of  a  friend    but  the  person  i  loved  laughed  at  me  and  the  path  i  chose        made  my  tries  at  a  relationship  seem  like  something  they  weren't    ever  since  then    i've  never  felt  more  like  i'm  not  worth  it  in  my  entire  life        i've  felt  the  same  way  to  this  day  and  i  struggle  to  sleep  because  of  it    i  spend  so  much  time  thinking  about  my  actions  and  what  i  could've  done  differently    and  regretting  all  of  it        it  brings  me  to  the  brink  of  tears    so  much  that  i'm  begging  myself  to  cry  and  let  out  the  weakness  and  pain      i  think  of  doing  terrible  things  to  myself  a  lot    but  i  shrug  those  thoughts  off  because  i'm  not  that  kind  of  coward  and  won't  ever  be    the  kind  of  coward  i  know  i  am  now  is  the  kind  who  struggles  to  wake  up  in  the  morning    to  allow  change  into  my  life  and  move  on    to  make  my  life  change    it's  so  hard  to  think  of  what  fun  thing  i  could  do  in  a  day  with  my  parents          you  wanna  go  axe  throwing                no    not  really            how  about  bowling                eh            why  not  go  out  for  a  walk  with  the  dogs    get  some  fresh  air                    i'm  trying  to  get  a  professional  therapist  to  see  if  i  can  get  some  help    but  i'm  just  as  unsure  of  doing  that  as  i  am  with  allowing  change  into  my  life    i'm  20  years  old  at  the  time  of  making  this  comment    and  i  genuinely  have  stopped  believing  in  myself  and  my  ability  to  find  my  purpose  in  life    it  sucks  being  sad  all  the  time  and  not  having  the  motivation  to  do  anything  that  could  be  noteworthy  but  talk  to  the  only  friend  i  have  anymore  and  my  parents,147,0.15309343434343434,1,song losing someone 's
