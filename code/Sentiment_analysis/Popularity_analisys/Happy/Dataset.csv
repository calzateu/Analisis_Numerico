ZbZSe6N_BXs,UgzOgZbO4a5SA1ZlF5V4AaABAg,Interesting  that  whether  you  like  or  dislike  this  song  depends  on  where  you  are  mentally      When  you're  in  a  bad  place    it's  stupid  and  the  words  of  a  rich  man  who  has  never    or  has  forgotten  what  reality  is    which  is  still  somewhat  true      But  as  you  start  coming  out  of  depression    it  helps  a  bit    It  almost  makes  you  feel  hopeful      I'll  have  to  revisit  this  comment  after  a  while    when  reality  has  had  time  to  kill  any  optimism  I'm  feeling  now  and  see  if  this  his  back  to  being  a  bunch  of  nonsense  for  people  that  can't  see  what's  happening  ,0
