just  simply  left  scars    or  the  regret  everyone  else  feels  by  not  doing  enough  to  help  you      3    It  does  get  better    Believe  it  or  not  it  will  eventually  get  better    Sometimes  you  have  to  go  through  the  storm  to  get  to  the  rainbow      4    There's  so  much  you  would  miss  out  on  doing      5    There  is  always  a  reason  to  live    It  might  not  be  clear  right  now    but  it  is  always  there      6    So  many  people  care    and  it  would  hurt  them  if  you  hurt  yourself      7    You  ARE  worth  it    Don't  let  anyone    especially  yourself    tell  you  otherwise      8    You  are  amazing      9    A  time  will  come    once  you've  battled  the  toughest  times  of  your  life  and  are  in  ease  once  again    where  you  will  be  so  glad  that  you  decided  to  keep  on  living    You  will  emerge  stronger  from  this  all    and  won't  regret  your  choice  to  carry  on  with  life    Because  things  always  get  better      10    What  about  all  the  things  you've  always  wanted  to  do    What  about  the  things  you've  planned    but  never  got  around  to  doing    You  can't  do  them  when  you're  dead      11    I  love  you    Even  if  only  one  person  loves  you    that's  still  a  reason  to  stay  alive      12    You  won't  be  able  to  listen  to  music  if  you  die      13    Killing  yourself  is  never  worth  it    You'll  hurt  both  yourself  and  all  the  people  you  care  about      14    There  are  so  many  people  that  would  miss  you    including  me      15    You're  preventing  a  future  generation    YOUR  KIDS    from  even  being  born      16    How  do  you  think  your  family  would  feel    Would  it  improve  their  lives  if  you  died      17    You're  gorgeous    amazing    and  to  someone  you  are  perfect      18    Think  about  your  favourite  music  artist    you'll  never  hear  their  voice  again

MwpMEbgC7DA,UgwJx3b6TwCrO-to7j14AaABAg,My  girlfriend  of  four  years  broke  up  with  me  a  couple  of  months  ago    back  in  January    2019      and  I  was  completely  devastated  for  around  two  months    I  cried  for  at  least  an  hour    every  single  day    throughout  the  first  month    She  was  everything  I  had  in  my  life        I  got  a  lot  of  experience  through  this  breakup    though      and  I  got  a  chance  to  truly  feel  emotions  like  never  before    several  times    I  even  had  to  vomit    when  I  got  very  sad        But  now    over  two  months  later    I  feel  simply  nothing    Just  nothing  at  all    is  the  best  way  to  describe  it    No  pain    no  anger    no  sorrow    no  happiness    nothing    Perhaps  due  to  my  mind  and  heart  being  exhausted  from  the  overly  emotional  period  I've  endured    And  what  worries  me  now    is  that  I  am  not  going  to  be  able  to  fall  in  love  again      hence  why  I  relate  SO  much  to  this  song      I  found  the  love  of  my  life    I  loved  everything  about  her      and  I  lost  her    I  am  not  sure  if  I'm  able  to  fall  in  love  like  that    again    I  have  trust  issues    as  the  main  reason  to  our  breakup  was  due  to  her  not  telling  me  about  her  thoughts  and  emotions    and  she  pretty  much  cheated  on  me  as  well      and  I  feel  like  my  mind  and  or  heart  won't  let  me  go  through  all  the  pain  again    if  things  won't  work  out  with  the  coming  partners      ,1734
