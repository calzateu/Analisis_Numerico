4ZHwu0uut3k,Ugyd4L3ms68sjs_lm3B4AaABAg,i  was  driving  down  a  canadian  highway  with  a  woman  that  led  me  on  a  4  hour  hike  on  a  snow  covered  mountain  where  she  lead  us  astray  and  night  started  to  fall    she  had  a  crazy  dog    but  a  genius  dog    he  lead  us  back  and  most  likely  saved  our  lives    when  we  got  back  to  her  truck  her  roommates  truck    the  windows  were  smashed  and  all  the  stuff  was  taken    including  a  macbook  pro    a  phone  and  sentimental  priceless  to  her    notes  she  took  while  traveling  india    i  wiped  the  glass  with  the  hoodie  i  wore  under  my  jacket    it  ripped    i  sat  in  the  back  holding  the  crazy  dog  from  jumping  out  the  window  as  we  were  driving  as  he  would  lunge  at  the  street  lights  and  oncoming  cars    we  got  back  to  the  starbucks  parking  lot  where  i  had  parked  my  friends  car  i  borrowed  to  drive  there    inside  the  starbucks  happened  to  be  some  officers  where  she  ran  in  to  get  a  case  going    after  30  minutes  of  a  freezing  interview  we  were  off    we  drove  to  a  gas  station  where  she  was  filling  her  roommates  truck  with  gas    a  homeless  man  asked  her  for  money    while  i  was  sitting  my  friends  car  with  her  dog  i  watched  her  seat  the  homeless  man  in  her  truck    as  we  were  in  a  rush  to  get  back  to  her  house  to  let  her  roommate  know  the  news  i  was  so  confused    anyways  i  followed  them  and  she  drove  to  a  cafe  she  used  to  work  at    we  arrived  and  she  came  to  car  saying  this  man  needed  some  food    we  went  inside  and  the  cafe  gave  us  water  and  some  food    they  didnt  give  it  to  us    i  opened  my  wallet  but  at  that  point  was  happy  she  wasnt  crying  anymore    while  sitting  there  with  them  she  left  the  table  to  go  talk  to  her  roommate  over  the  phone    i  then  sat  with  this  poor  soul  who  admitted  he  had  been  using  heroin  constantly  for  years  and  that  he  was  uncomfortable  where  he  was  and  stated  to  me  he  was  just  as  confused  as  to  why  she  brought  him  here    when  she  came  back  she  came  with  a  notebook  and  then  started  to  do  a  medical  diagnosis  on  this  man  she  had  been  studying  for  a  medical  exam  some  time  in  her  past  this  will  feed  into  the  story  later      the  man  finally  freaked  out  after  sitting  there  for  so  long  and  said  he  just  wanted  to  leave    it  was  so  strange  to  see  someone  wanting  to  help  someone  in  this  manner  from  where  i  come  from    but  thats  not  to  say  i  couldnt  respect  it    after  she  told  this  man  several  solutions  in  regards  to  where  he  could  go  on  this  freezing  night  she  finally  agreed  to  leave  him    back  in  our  cars  we  went    she  in  the  truck  and  i  in  my  friends  car  with  her  dog    as  we  pulled  out  of  the  lot  she  was  going  at  a  crazy  speed  out  of  no  where    she  ran  multiple  reds  and  i  eventually  lost  her    having  her  dog  in  the  back  i  was  totally  lost  i  didnt  know  what  to  do        my  mobile  plan  is  with  freedom  mobile  which  has  limited  service  in  that  area  so  i  was  just  driving  around  hoping  to  find  another  starbucks  or  mcdonalds  or  anywhere  with  free  wifi    finally  i  found  a  spot  which  was  a  car  part  store  i  can  no  longer  recall  the  name  of  but  it  had  free  wifi  for  shaw  users  freedom  was  a  daughter  company  of  freedom      i  went  on  facebook  and  tracked  down  the  roommate  who  told  me  her  address    i  made  it  to  this  house  where  the  girl  i  was  following  was  no  where  to  be  found    the  roommate  came  out  with  her  parents  and  they  were  completely  emotionally  having  heard  their  truck  had  all  the  windows  smashed  and  seeing  me  there  with  the  dog  but  no  girl  and  no  truck    i  hug  the  roommate  as  i  met  her  when  i  met  this  girl  i  was  with  at  a  club  where  i  worked  in  vancouver  far  from  where  i  was    the  parents  seemed  on  edge  but  understandingly    after  a  tearful  while  finally  after  the  girl  arrived    she  was  retracing  her  steps  trying  to  find  me  after  realzing  she  ditched  me  in  the  rush    the  roommate  and  her  parents  then  chose  that  moment  to  state  this  girl  was  no  longer  welcome  in  their  house        it  was  a  freezing  night  in  canada    the  girl  i  was  with  in  her  words  said  her  own  parents    disowned  her    but  i  told  her  to  call  them  anyways  and  after  a  while  she  finally  caved  and  called    but  her  dad  was  as  cold  as  the  night    his  voice  seemed  responsible  though  and  the  words  he  spoke  haunt  me  today    i  will  not  reveal  them  but  it  seemed  this  girl  had  done  something  to  those  within  her  family  unforgivable    it  was  at  that  point  though  i  didnt  really  know  her  i  invited  her  and  her  dog  back  to  my  mothers  house  which  was  a  2  hour  drive  back  to  the  city  the  hike  was  supposed  to  be  a  2  hour  venture    it  was  around  10pm    having  no  options  she  agreed    we  then  drove  with  this  song  on  repeat    stopping  at  a  few  stores  to  get  dog  food  and  food  for  ourselves    2  hours  later  we  arrive  in  the  city  but  i  could  not  go  home  as  i  left  my  electric  car  with  my  friend  and  the  deal  was  i  take  her  gas  car  and  return  to  him  before  he  left  work  so  we  had  to  go  directly  to  the  club  where  i  worked  to  do  the  exchange    we  got  there  and  took  the  dog  for  a  short  walk  before  leaving  it  in  the  parkade  with  my  car    the  dog  being  part  wolf  not  actually  but  the  energy  this  thing  had  i'd  describe  it  like  that    was  still  bouncing  around  so  i  told  her  to  wait  however  she  stated  she  didnt  want  to  wait  for  me  and  came  with  me  into  the  club    we  got  into  the  club  and  the  ladies  stopped  her  to  check  her  id  which  she  didnt  have  because  she  wasnt  allowed  to  go  into  the  house  to  get  any  of  her  things    should  have  mentioned  that  but  i'm  already  exceeding  every  other  youtube  comment  you've  ever  seem  so  i'm  not  going  back  to  correct  it  sorry    so  we  had  to  wait  at  the  door  wherefinally  the  owner  my  employer  and  friend    came  and  allowed  the  entry    as  we  walked  in  the  craziest  sound        this  song  once  again      it  was  the  final  hour  so  the  djs  had  been  wrapping  up  so  someones  phone  was  in  the  aux  even  though  the  club  still  had  a  big  pop  inside  it    we  danced  which  i  never  do    for  the  last  minute  of  it    it  was  a  brief  moment  of  peace  in  a  time  of  uncertainty  for  both  this  woman  and  i    the  story  continues  and  goes  quite  south  actually    including  her  using  my  library  card  to  rent  a  mcat  book  and  never  returning  it  i  include  this  only  cause  i  promised  above    didnt  think  there  was  so  much  my  goodness    after  staying  more  then  a  week  at  my  mothers  house  while  i  paid  for  her  dogs  food  as  she  had  no  money    i  was  more  then  happy  with  that    in  fact  at  the  end  i  loved  the  dog  and  not  her  loll    during  these  times  she  continued  these  crazy  occurrences  for  example  the  times  she  insisted  we  had  s      inside  mycar  yet  while  on  parked  beside  the  public  side  walk  while  charging  my  electric  car  on  the  streets  of  vancouver  im  not  kidding  when  i  say  she  insisted    i  literally  told  her  no  and  she  undressed  herself    it  was  something  my  inner  barbarian  that  could  not  refuse  but  regrets  given  the  amount  of  people  that  walked  by  lord  save  me      i'm  going  to  end  this  now    i  have  had  to  replay  the  song  4  times  during  the  writing  of  it    i  have  finally  given  up  proof  reading  i  hope  it's  legible    i  feel  i  could  write  triple  this  paragraphs  in  the  events  that  followed    like  how  i  finally  got  her  out  of  my  mothers  house  or  how  she  treated  my  brother  while  staying  with  us    or  how  the  encounter  went  getting  1  of  the  2  books  back  whle  i  had  another  girl  in  the  car  to  shield  my  inner  barbarian  from  action  lol    crazy  times    i  thank  the  lord  my  life  is  much  more  peaceful  now    its  funny  cause  as  a  young  man  you  wish  for  crazy  times  like  that  and  crazy  s      experiences  but  when  i  finally  got  it  and  was  stuck  in  the  middle  i  finally  learned  i  was  wrong    if  you  actually  read  all  this  cheers  to  you    good  luck  in  life,0,0.005865943737230858,1,driving canadian highway woman led 4 hour hike snow covered mountain lead
