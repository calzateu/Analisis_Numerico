24u3NoPvgMw,UgxzeThJkipxunOgwaV4AaABAg,i  have  a  story    for  anyone  that  wants  to  hear  it    this  is  about  my  best  friend  and  massive  lifelong  crush      let's  call  my  friend    h        so    we  met  in  2nd  grade  when  she  moved  to  my  school    in  kentucky    from  hawaii    at  the  time  i  had  a  different  friend    let's  call  her    c      so    me  and  c  had  been  friends  since  kindergarten    i  knew  that  c  was  going  to  go  into  homeschooling  at  the  end  of  the  year    so  i  was  feeling  really  sad  and  tried  to  make  some  new  friends    at  first  i  hated  h  because  i  thought  she  was  trying  to  steal  c  from  me    but  after  a  while  me    c    and  h  became  a  group    as  it  neared  the  end  of  the  year    i  met  this  random  boy    we  will  call  him    b      so    when  i  met  b  i  didn't  know  what  to  think  because  i  had  only  had  female  friends  before  this    i  started  to  develop  feelings  for  b    b  didn't  like  my  other  friends    so  i  wasn't  sure  how  to  feel  or  what  to  do  since  i  had  to  choose  between  b    who  i  fell  really  hard  for      or  c  and  h    it  was  the  end  of  second  grade    and  me  and  h  said  our  last  goodbyes  to  c    we  never  saw  c  again    in  3rd  grade    ms  and  h  were  in  different  classes    me  and  b  were  in  the  same  class  again    me  and  b  had  other  friends    which  aren't  important  enough  to  name      and  at  this  point  i  had  h    and  me  and  b's  friend  group    b  hated  h    i  ended  up  telling  h  about  my  feelings  for  b    then  i  told  a  few  other  people    as  expected    b  found  out    b  started  to  drift  away  from  me    and  those  other  friends  followed    i  tried  to  talk  to  b  but  he  didn't  want  anything  to  do  with  me    by  the  end  of  the  year    all  i  had  was  h    then  the  year  ended    when  4th  grade  started    i  was  still  heartbroken  over  b    b  thought  i  was  weird  and  hated  me  at  this  point    h  told  me  she  had  something  to  tell  me    h  told  me  that  she  was  moving  schools  and  probably  wouldn't  be  seeing  me  in  5th  grade    i  was  heartbroken    h  was  all  i  had    and  we  still  talked  about  c  sometimes    and  finding  c    it  was  the  end  of  the  fourth  grade  year    me  and  h  said  our  final  goodbyes    and  i  was  on  my  own    when  5th  grade  started    i  found  out  that  b  was  going  to  the  same  middle  school  as  me    to  be  honest    at  this  point  i  was  pretty  much  a  stalker    i  could  understand  why  he  would  hate  me  now    because  i  started  to  be  obsessive    but    you  know    first  loves    amirite    but  seriously    i  was  so  excited    over  the  years  everyone  at  my  elementary  had  found  out  about  my  crush    and  since  middle  school  was  starting    it  would  be  a  secret  again    right    yep    too  much  of  a  secret    i  did  my  whole  sixth  grade  year  virtual  and  thought  of  it  as  the  perfect  opportunity  to  escape  my  feelings  for  b    nope    actually    more  of  a  chance  to  embrace  them    i  know  this  sounds  dumb    but  i  would  just  stare  at  his  black  zoom  box  with  his  name    goofy  smile  on  my  face      just  remembering    over  the  years  i  had  faked  so  many  crushes  to  try  and  get  away  from  this  one    and  i  was  just  thinking  how  bad  of  a  stalker  i  was  to  b    he  was  introvert    and  i  am    and  have  always  been    extrovert    to  try  and  distract  myself  from  this  crush    i  emailed  my  old  friend    h    i  didn't  know  if  that  email  even  worked  anymore    but  surprise    i  got  an  email  back    she  told  me  her  discord    and  i  told  her  mine    we  stayed  in  contact  ever  since    now    i  had  another  problem    i  had  an  online  friend    e    who  introduced  me  to  her  online  friend    r    me  and  e  didn't  really  contact  anymore    and  me  and  r  became  closer    eventually    i  caught  feelings  for  r  so  i  confessed  to  her    she  said  she  liked  me    too    and  i  thought  i  escaped    i  introduced  h  to  r  and  r  hated  h    r  brainwashed  me  into  thinking  h  didn't  care  about  me    it  was  just  me  and  r  now    but  at  the  end  of  my  6th  grade  year  i  found  out  i  needed  to  go  to  summer  school    i  got  my  phone  taken  until  i  finished  it      mind  you    me  and  r  had  made  plans  to  literally  live  together  and  get  married  in  the  future  btw    by  this  time  i  had  forgotten  about  b    i  was  in  summer  school    doing  my  work    yk    as  it  goes    when  i  finished    though    everything  changed    i  went  to  text  r  and  tell  her  i  was  done    but  what  i  opened  her  contact  to  was  crushing      i  got  a  girlfriend  2  weeks  ago  and  i  was  scared  to  tell  you  so  i  dont  have  a  crush  on  you  anymore      that's  it    we  got  into  a  massive  argument    i  ended  up  cutting  off  all  contact  with  her    i  was  alone  again    everything  had  gotten  so  bad    i  started  thinking  about  b  again    how  had  an  innocent  little  childhood  crush  turned  into  this    i  was  so  mad  at  myself  for  letting  it  get  this  out  of  control    i  didn't  like  his  as  much    but  memories    you  know      by  the  start  of  7th  grade    i  had  stopped  thinking  about  him    my  friendship  with  h  had  been  revived    but  h  wasn't  the  same    sweet    loving  soul    h  is  now  just  kinda  depressed    i'm  sure    h  went  to  visit  her  grandma  in  sc  right  as  covid  started  and  is  now  stuck  with  her    so  now  lives  there    i'm  not  the  same  either    though    so  i  can't  complain    i  have  new  friendships  now    and  my  life  is  starting  to  look  up    i'm  homeschooled    but  in  the  time  that  i  was  going  to    in  person    i  made  a  decent

 crush  on  b    and  i  know  this  sounds  stupid    but  it  kinda  saved  me    because  obsessing  over  someone  who  you  haven't  spoken  to  in  4  years  isn't  healthy    anyways    7th

qVdPh2cBTN0,Ugym8KPeZNN46z-Vgi94AaABAg,hi    my  name  is  tylorace  and  i  have  a  message  for  the  people  who  need  it    written  by  me  and  i  think  the  world  should  hear  what  im  trying  to  say    as  a  great  actor  once  said        the  world  ain't  all  sunshine  and  rainbows    it's  a  very  mean  and  nasty  place  and  i  don't  care  how  tough  you  are  it  will  beat  you  to  your  knees  and  keep  you  there  permanently  if  you  let  it        now  you  may  think  that  quote  alone  is  inspirational    but  it  s  not  what  you  read    it  s  what  you  do    you  may  not  be  fine    and  that  s  perfectly  fine  you  may  not  be  ok    and  thats  ok      feel  what  you  feel  but  don  t  let  it  control  your  life    the  doors  of  opportunity  are  unlocked  but  you  ll  never  know  until  you  try  and  open  them  first    you  have  to  be  your  strongest  when  you  are  at  your  weakest    tough  times  dont  last    tough  people  do    success  is  no  accident    it  is  hard  work    perseverance    learning  studying    sacrifice    and  most  of  all    love  what  you  are  doing  or  learning  to  do    the  key  to  success  is  focusing  on  goals  not  obstacles    learn  to  appreciate  what  you  have  before  time  makes  you  appreciate  for  what  you  had    if  the  plan  doesn  t  work    change  the  plan  not  the  goal    if  you  don  t  sacrifice  for  what  you  want    what  you  want  becomes  the  sacrifice    it  takes  nothing  to  join  the  crowd    it  takes  everything  to  stand  alone    don  t  let  yesterday  take  up  too  much  of  today    sometimes  we  are  tested    not  to  find  our  weaknesses    but  to  find  our  strengths    don  t  expect  to  see  a  change  if  you  don  t  make  one    there  are  no  limits  to  what  you  can  accomplish      except  the  limits  you  place  in  your  own  thinking    if  you  think  it  s  hard  and  you    can  t  do  it    don  t  turn  down  opportunities    because  every  decision  you  make  comes  down  to  one  moment    in  the  middle  of  difficulty  lies  opportunity    this  is  for  everyone  who  thinks  the're  nothing    people  in  this  world  are  going  to  fool  you  disappoint  you  turn  their  back  on  you  the  closest  around  you  are  going  to  give  up  on  you  and  when  shit  hit  the  fan  everybody  is  gonna  run  you  gonna  look  around  and  you  will  be  all  alone    i  know  what  you're  going  through    god  will  never  leave  you  nor  forsake  you  and  that  is  all  you  need  there's  a  power  inside  of  you  that  you  can  only  discover  when  you  are  truly  alone  just  as  the  waves  on  a  beach  shore  come  in  and  out  people  will  do  the  same  relationships  are  like  music  and  you  should  never  make  music  with  anybody  who  doesn't  understand    appreciate  and  value  your  lyrics    sometimes    you  just  got  to  let  these  people  go  you  got  to  know  your  worth    you  got  to  stop  chasing  people  who  don't  appreciate  you    sometimes  in  this  life  you  gotta  remind  the  world  just  who  you  are    and  you  don't  do  this  by  telling  them  with  your  mouth    you  tell  them  with  your  actions    you  take  your  actions    don't  let  the  world  convince  you  that  you're  nobody    you're  somebody  who  just  don't  know  it  yet    you  haven  t  failed  100  times    you  have  successfully  found  100  ways  that  didn  t  work    no  one  is  a  failure    there  s  no  such  thing  as  winning  or  losing    there  is  won  and  there  is  lost    there  is  victory  and  defeat    there  are  absolutes    everything  in  between  is  still

 this  very  second    every  second  more  then  billions  of  people  leave  this  world    but  you  are  still  here  aren  t  you        look  at  how  much  you  ve  been  threw  and  you  re  still  here    that  means  that  god  still  has  plans  for  you    please  don  t  give  up    please  don  t  hurt  yourself    don  t  do  suicide    things  will  get  better  if  you  believe  in  it    please  don  t  give  up    look  at  how  far  you  made  it    if  there  are  billions  of  people  dying  every  second    and  you  are  still  alive    its  for  a  purpose    i  m  a  teenage  girl  who  has  a    perfect    life    or  that  s  what  others  think    you  see    i  am  very  nice  to  everyone    and  no  matter  what  they  have  done  in  their  life    bad  or  very  bad    no  matter  what  mistake  or  how  many  mistakes  they  made    i  will  stick  up  for  them  and  be  supportive    i  ve  always  been  there  for  everyone    i  support  them  when  they  need  it    i  write  paragraphs  of  supporting  and  loving  words    but  when  i  need  someone  there  for  me    all  i  get  is    mood    or    poor  girl    or    i  hope  it  gets  better    and  that  s  it    not  even  a  single  paragraph    just  a  short  phrase    now  that  s  only  one  problem    another  one  is  that  i  m  very  shy    well  that  s  what  people  think    i  used  to  be  a  very  outgoing  girl    i  would  always  talk  about  how  my  day  was    i  would  always  be  talking  normally  with  people    but  then  it  came  to  the  point  where  a  lot  of  people  told  me  that  i  was    too  loud    and  i  am  a  very  sensitive  person  and  at  first  i  just  said    oh    sorry    and  i  would  talk  more  quiet    but  eventually  more  people  told  me  that  i  was  talking    too  loud    and  so  that  leads  me  to  not  talking  at  all    which  leads  me  to  being  without  friends  bc  apparently  i  am    too  quiet    and  i  barely  talk    we  went  to  a  teens  winter  camp    and  everyone  was  just  leaving  me  out    whenever  they  would  go  somewhere    nobody  would  tell  me  and  then  next  thing  you  know    i  was  alone    and  my  older  sister  is  the  best  sister  i  can  ask  for    she  came  up  to  my  cousin  and  asked  why  they  left  me  out    and  what  she  said  was      it  s  her  fault  she  never  talks      and  do  you  know  what        she  was  the  one  that  told  me  i  was  talking    too  loud    to  the  point  i  never  talk    now  the  next  thing    now  that  i  don  t  talk  much    i  don  t  have  any  friends    and  when  i  meet  a  new  person  that  actually  talks  with  me  and  likes  to  hang  out  with  me    i  get  too  excited  and  eventually  open  up  too  much  and  then  i  talk  too  much    and  do  you  know  what  that  leads  to      them  saying  that  i  m  annoying    and  that  made  me  even  worse    so  now  i  don  t  talk  at  all    now    the  same  cousin  that  told  me  i  was    too  loud    and  then      it  s  not  my  fault  she  doesn  t  talk      has  a  family  that  has  five  beautiful  girls    and  guess  what      my  parents  expect  me  and  my  siblings  to  be  like  them    but  what  they  don  t  know    are  their  true  colors    they  are  fake    they  judge  everyone    and  more    and  everyone  sees  them  as    perfect      now  i  still  love  them  bc  they  are  my  family    but  if  anyone  actually  even  read  this    moving  on  to  my  uncle    all  i  can  say  is  that  i  hate  him  but  i  don  t  want  to    and  if  you  re  wondering  why  i  hate  my  uncle      it  s  because  he  makes  jokes  about  me  being  fat    i  am  kind  of  a  big  girl    and  when  he  makes  those  jokes  i  tell  myself  that    it  s  just  a  joke      but  it  got  to  the  point  where  even  my  sister  couldn  t  handle  it  and  said  that  it  s  going  way  too  far    so  she  told  my  mom  that  he  has  been  making  jokes  about  me  being    big    for  quite  a  while  now  and  that  it  s  going  too  far    and  what  does  my  mom  say    she  says  that  i  m  being  too  dramatic  and  that  its  just  a  joke    now  don  t  get  me  wrong    my  mom  is  the  best  mom  i  could  ever  have    but  she  just  doesn  t  see  it  because  that  s  her  sister  husband    so  we  went  to  camp  for  a  week  with  my  uncles  family    and  one  day  when  we  went  swimming    i  put  my  red  bathing  suit  on    and  i  had  to  constantly  pull  it  up  because  my  cherries  would  show    so  i  went  to  make  sand  castles  with  my  little  sister  and  my  little  cousin    we  were  playing  and  building  and  i  had  to  bend  over  to  fix  the  castle  on  the  other  side    all  i  heard  was  my  aunt  saying    where  are  you  looking    or    stop  looking  there    i  don  t  really  remember    but  then  she  says    hey  corina    pull  up  your  bathing  suit  top      and  i  pulled  it  up  and  then  i  looked  up  and  what  did  i  see      my  uncle  laughing    now  a  couple  days  later  when  we  were  leaving    we  put  everything  in  the  car    and  there  was  a  lot  of  stuff  since  we  went  there  for  a  week    and  so  my  dad  told  me  to  sit  in  the  back  of  the  car  because  my  brother  gets  car  sick  very  easily  and  it  was  going  to  be  a  3  hour  drive    so  i  sat  in  the  back  of  the  care  and  there  wasn  t  a  lot  of  space    i  was  next  to  the  window  and  then  there  was  a  bunch  of  stuff  right  next  to  me    while  my  parents  went  to  take  some  more  stuff      btw  it  s  night    my  uncle  flashes  a  flashlight  on  me  through  the  window  and  says    are  you  going  to  make  it  home      and  then  starts  laughing    i  then  start  crying  because  i  couldn  t  handle  it  anymore  and  so  that  s  when  my  sister  told  me  mom    and  that  s  when  she  said  that  i  was  overreacting    i  have  a  lot  of  problems  in  my  life    but  i  don  t  give  up    instead  i  write  these  paragraphs  to  people  who  are  having  issues    some  have  a  few  issues    and  some  have  a  lot  of  big  issues  in  their  life    and  i

qVdPh2cBTN0,UgyvNjzNvulNaQSe4bV4AaABAg,this  song  reminded    me  of  my  younger  self    yesterday  i  was  looking  at  pictures  when  i  was  little    i  could  see  how  happy  and  free  i  was    i  didn't  even  know  what  depression    hatred  meant    i  didn't  even  think  about  my  look    because  then  every  problem  was  small  for  me    i  never  wondered  what  i  would  be  like  when  i  grew  up    but  i  least  expected  to  be  like  i  am  today    i  didn't  think  that  the  happy  child  in  the  picture  would  be  depressed  today      would  want  to  take  her  own  life  at  a  young  age    i'm  sorry  that  i  became  a  completely  different  person      i  can't  help  myself  at  all    but  i  still  like  to  help  others    because  that  makes  me  feel  better  knowing  that  i  have  helped  someone    i  m  not  living  anymore    i  m  hardly  even  surviving    unlike  today's  generation    i  feel  very  more  mature    maybe  it's  because  of  depression    someone  said  that  people  with  depression  usually  grow  up  faster    the  problem  is  that  my  parents  don't  care  about  me  and  my  sisters  at  all    they  just  think  about  their  problems    and  my  sisters    they  take  depression  and  anxiety  as  a  joke          what  would  it  mean  to  me  to  tell  them  how  i  feel          they  would  probably  make  fun  of  me    its  really  sad    that  no  one  in  your  life  suspects  that  anything  is  going  on    i  also  had  a  friend  i  knew  for  9  years    but  she  soon  replaced  me  with  someone  else    it  was  very  difficult  for  me    because  i  was  used    since  i  was  a  child    to  always  be  with  her    and  i  didn't  go  anywhere  without  her    which  caused  me  anxiety  today    i  have  no  reason  to  continue  living    i  am  tired  of  everything    of  school    of  people  who  hurt  and  harass  me  all  the  time    of  my  parents  who  constantly  quarrel  and  who  even  find  it  difficult  to  take  me  to  the  doctor  when  i  am  sick  so  they  don  t  have  to  spend  money  on  me    i  can  no  longer  endure    i  would  like  to  have  someone  who  would  understand  me    but  i  m  all  alone  doing  everything  by  myself    three  months  ago  my  grandparents  both  died  in  one  week    which  broke  me  and  exhausted  me  a  lot    i  couldn't  believe  it  had  happened    after  that    everything  started  to  get  worse    i'm  afraid  to  do  something  to  myself    but  i  can't  live  this  life  anymore    it  is  hard  to  live  every  day  with  such  thoughts  and  such  sadness  in  your  head    depression  is  killing  me    i  don't  know  how  much  longer  i  will  last    this  song  is  definitely  one  of  the  most  emotional  song  i  ve  ever  listened  to    i  can  find  myself  in  it    i'm  sorry  that  happy  little  me  without  a  single  problem  disappeared        today  s  people  would  do  anything  just  to  hurt  you    i  am  sorry  that  some  people  think  that  they  have  to  look  as  beautiful  as  celebrities  in  order  for  someone  to  accept  them    they  have  allowed  their  insecurities  to  take  over  who  they  used  to  be    i  am  sorry  that  they  are  ashamed  of  their  faces  and  bodies    yet  all  this  is  given  by  god    why  would  he  make  you  like  that      i  think  he  sees  you  so  perfectly      i  understand    it's  very  difficult  isn't  it          i  lock  myself  in  the  room  and  only  come  out  when  i  absolutely  have  to    which  is  usually  for  dinner    i  no  longer  have  the  motivation  to  do  anything    my  head  starts  spinning  and  i  can't  take  it  anymore,1019,-0.02467640692640693,0,song reminded younger self yesterday looking pictures little could see happy free n't even know depression hatred meant n't even think look every problem small never wondered would like grew least expected like today n't think happy child picture would depressed today would want take life young age 'm sorry became completely different person ca n't help still like help others makes feel better knowing helped someone living anymore hardly even surviving unlike today 's generation feel mature maybe 's depression someone said people depression usually grow faster problem parents n't care sisters think problems sisters take depression anxiety joke would mean tell feel would probably make fun really sad one life suspects anything going also friend knew 9 years soon replaced someone else difficult used since child always n't go anywhere without caused anxiety today reason continue living tired everything school people hurt harass time parents constantly quarrel even find difficult take doctor sick spend money longer endure would like someone would understand alone everything three months ago grandparents died one week broke exhausted lot could n't believe happened everything started get worse 'm afraid something ca n't live life anymore hard live every day thoughts sadness head depression killing n't know much longer

failed  or  just  simply  left  scars  or  the  regret  everyone  else  feels  by  not  doing  enough  to  help  you        3    it  does  get  better    believe  it  or  not    it  will  eventually  get  better      sometimes  you  have  to  go  through  the  storm  to  get  to  the  rainbow        4    there's  so  much  you  would  miss  out  on  doing        5    there  is  always  a  reason  to  live    it  might  not  be  clear  right  now        but  it  is  always  there        6    so  many  people  care    and  it  would  hurt  them  if  you  hurt  yourself        7    you  are  worth  it    don't  let  anyone    especially  yourself    tell  you  otherwise        8    you  are  amazing        9    a  time  will  come    once  you've  battled  the  toughest  times  of  your  life  and  are  at  ease  once  again    where  you  will  be  so  glad  that  you  decided  to  keep  on  living    you  will  emerge  stronger  from  this  all    and  won't  regret  your  choice  to  carry  on  with  life    because  things  always  get  better        10    what  about  all  the  things  you've  always  wanted  to  do    what  about  the  things  you've  planned    but  never  got  around  to  doing    you  can't  do  them  when  you're  dead        11    i  love  you    even  if  only  one  person  loves  you    that's  still  a  reason    to  stay  alive        12    you  won't  be  able  to  listen  to  music  if  you  die        13    killing  yourself  is  never  worth  it    you'll  hurt  both  yourself  and    all  the  people  you  care  about        14    there  are  so  many  people  that  would  miss  you    including  me        15    you're  preventing  a  future  generation    your  kids    from  even  being  born        16    how  do  you  think  your

the  human  race  has  come  to  adopt  over  the  final  frontier    something  happens  to  the  ship    perhaps  an  internal  fire  or  something    small  escape  pods  are  shot  out    each  with  a  capacity  of  two    a  young  kid  and  his  ai  projection  of  his  best  friend's  consciousness    kinda  like  a  robot  pal  lmao    board  one  of  the  pods    there's  a  complication  during  launch    and  the  two  both  get  trapped  in  the  pod  in  the  middle  of  space    the  oxygen  in  the  pod  is  running  out    the  emergency  lights  are  flashing    the  kid  has  known  this  person  all  his  life    and  wishes  to  protect  what  little  piece  he  still  has  of  his  friend    he  knows  he  won't  live  much  longer    and  wants  to  spend  his  last  moment  with  his  friend      1  43  the  ai  knows  that  it  could  survive  outside  the  pod  just  fine    but  also  knows  that  their  friend  couldn't    thus  vowing  to  protect  him  at  all  costs    the  pressure  inside  the  pod  becomes  too  great    exploding  with  the  two  still  inside    just  before  the  explosion    robot  guy      i  didn't  really

and  they  make  it  back  to  their  own  planet  safely    at  the  next  buildup      the  one  with  the  strong  beat  behind  it    we  see  the  same  kid    grown  up    working  to  remake  the  friend  he'd  lost  so  many  years  ago    as  he's  working    he  gets  flashbacks  to  the  pod  and  the  explosion    after  years  and  years  of  studying  and  training  and  working  his  way  up  the  ranks    he  still  hasn't  let  go  of  that  dream    he  grows  up    gets  a  family    becomes  a  father    but  still  wants  to  recreate  something  he'd  lost    deep  down    he  knows  he  shouldn't    and  that  the  ai  died    for    him    not  because  of  him    he  blames  himself  for  the  death    and  wants  to  apologize    he  successfully  remakes  the  ai    and    when  it  stands  before  him    he  breaks  down    the  memories  come  rushing  back    everything  from  their  lives  together  as  children    to  his  friend  dying  the

W2TE0DjdNqI,UgxIljA4BBtaHvdf0ZZ4AaABAg,in  august  of  2009    my  family  and  i  adopted  a  black  lab  husky  cross  dog    i  was  6  at  the  time    and  am  now  18    he  was  3  years  old  at  the  time  of  adoption    he  was  the  best  pet    and  more  importantly    the  best  friend  i  ever  could  have  asked  for    i  grew  up  with  him  for  two  thirds  of  my  life    he  started  out  with  almost  no  white  hairs  at  all    only  a  white  patch  on  his  chest  and  some  white  fur  on  the  bottoms  of  his  paws    12  years  later    he  had  a  lot  more  white  hairs    but  still  was  mostly  black  haired    he  even  had  a  little  part  on  his  upper  lip  that  made  it  look  like  he  had  a  moustache    whenever  i  felt  sad  or  alone    he  was  always  someone  i  could  go  to  for  comfort    he  loved  to  be  pet    and  i  made  sure  to  spend  as  much  time  as  i  could  with  him  recently    he  used  to  be  so  energetic    always  up  and  about    ready  to  do  something    he  loved  to  go  for  rides  in  the  car    even  to  the  point  where  if  someone  spoke  the  word    ride      his  little  black  ears  would  perk  up    and  he  would  smile    ready  to  go    same  thing  with  walks    he  loved  to  walk  around  town    but  over  the  past  few  years    he  began  to  have  much  less  energy    up  until  maybe  a  month  ago  however    he  was  always  ready  to  go  for  a  walk    even  in  the  winter    his  health  began  to  decline  exponentially  over  the  past  one  to  two  years    and  for  the  past  year    found  it  harder  and  harder  to  get  up  and  walk    up  to  a  week  ago    he  could  hardly  even  walk  at  all    almost  falling  over  constantly  due  to  his  hind  legs  giving  out    he  was  in  a  lot  of  pain  for  a  while    the  pain  only  getting  worse  and  worse  over  time    every  time  i  would  go  into  the  kitchen  to  make  food    he  was  always  there    watching  me  with  beady    puppy  dog  eyes    i  almost  always  gave  him  a  little  treat    whether  it  be  some  cheese    some  sandwich  meat    or  a  dog  treat    every  time  we  ordered  food    he  was  always  there  to  greet  the  delivery  driver    a  couple  days  ago    he  couldn't  even  get  up  at  all    but  when  we  ordered  pizza  just  two  days  ago    he  managed  to  find  the  energy  to  get  up  and  meet  the  delivery  guy      he  was  the  friendliest  dog  too    he  never  bit  anybody    but  was  always  wagging  his  tail    happy  to  see  someone  new    he  loved  to  meet  new  people    and  loved  seeing  the  same  people  again  even  more      on  october  26th    2021    raider  took  a  ride  in  the  car  for  the  last  time  to  the  vet    surrounded  by  the  people  that  loved  him    he  closed  his  eyes    and  had  moved  on  from  the  mortal  realm    he  is  no  longer  in  any  pain    he's  somewhere  far  better  now    probably  chasing  some  birds  or  squirrels  like  he  had  done  in  his  youth    you  will  forever  be  missed  buddy      today

W2TE0DjdNqI,Ugzi19weqTO1vmOGfO94AaABAg,the  real  story  behind  this  song    the  earth  became  uninhabitable    you  could  no  longer  see  the  vibrant  colors  in  the  sky  when  the  sun  rose  in  the  morning  and  set  in  the  night    the  temperatures  skyrocketed  above  the  average  to  the  point  where  if  you  stepped  outside    your  skin  would  fry  in  a  few  minutes    fires  tore  through  forests  and  demolished  farms    the  roads  were  littered  with  animal  carcasses    sometimes  even  humans        humanity  was  forced  to  leave    forced  to  live  in  space  for  hundreds  of  years    billions  were  left  behind  to  die  on  earth    only  the  lucky  ones  were  able  to  escape  into  space    but  really    nobody  was  lucky  in  the  end    the  survivors  in  the  space  station  were  never  happy  and  were  always  waiting  for  the  day  when  they  would  be  allowed  back  on  earth      that  day  finally  came  after  four  hundred  years    a  completely  new  generation  of  humans  had  been  born    still  longing  to  go  to  earth    the  government  officials  had  gathered  everyone  together  and  announced  they  would  be  sending  one  trainee  to  earth  to  check  the  conditions    doubtful  whispered  passed  through  the  crowd    some  claiming  it  was  a    suicide  mission          the  officials  hushed  the  crowd  till  their  voices  became  whispers    then  they  spoke      daniel  farewall  has  been  assigned  the  mission  by  the  president          a  cry  rang  out  among  the  mass  of  people    all  eyes  turned  to  a  woman  standing  in  the  back    her  eyes  were  glossy  and  her  face  was  thin    framed  by  short  black  hair    it  was  petunia  farewall    daniel  s  mother          he  s  just  a  boy      she  cried  out    clenching  her  fists          daniel  is  the  right  one  for  the  job    ma  am      the  official  responded    his  voice  monotone        petunia  shoved  her  way  through  the  crowd    tears  sliding  down  her  cheeks    till  she  reached  the  front      he  s  all  i  have    please    you  can  t  do  this          i  m  afraid  we  can      the  officer  said    a  light  mocking  in  his  tone    he  raised  one  gloved  hand  in  the  air  and  two  officials  joined  petunia  at  her  side    grabbing  her  by  each  arm    they  coaxed  her  from  the  room    ignoring  her  cries  of  desperation    the  crowd  was  deathly  silent          it  has  been  settled    daniel  farewall  will  go  to  earth  this  coming  full  moon              the  second  week  of  october  had  passed  and  the  moon  was  shining  through  the  space  station  windows    daniel  was  getting  ready  in  the  boarding  deck  after  he  had  said  his  goodbyes  to  his  friends  and  family    he  felt  quite  honored  to  have  been  chosen  for  this  position    random  people  would  pat  his  shoulder  or  give  a  slight  nod  in  his  direction  as  he  passed  by    he  didn  t  understand  why  everyone  had  been  so  emotional  saying  goodbye    he  was  coming  back    wasn  t  he      as  the  general  handed  him  his  instructions  for  when  he  arrived  on  earth    he  adjusted  daniel  s  helmet  on  his  head      try  to  get  as  much  information  as  you  can      the  general  said      daniel  nodded    then  said      should  i  bring  back  earth  samples    maybe  i  could  collect  some  dirt    or  maybe  a  plant    if  there  are  any        the  general  laughed  bitterly        bring  back      there  s  no  way  back  up  from  the  transport  pod    farewall          what  do  you  mean          you  re  staying  down  there          for  how  long          however  long  it  takes  for  you  to  die    days    hours    or  seconds    who  knows        daniel  s  eyes  widened  as  he  took  a  step  back  in  surprise      i  don  t  understand    sir    this  wasn  t  part  of  my  training        the  general  gripped  his  shoulder  and  pulled  him  toward  two  metal  doors  that  slid  open  when  they  got  near      don  t  forget  to  keep  us  updated    you  have  that  intercom  in  your  suit  for  a  reason        before  daniel  could  reply    he  was  pushed  into  the  transport  pod  and  the  doors  closed  behind  him    he  stood    unmoving    for  a  moment    his  thoughts  running  through  his  brain    he  turned  to  the  metal  doors  and  pounded  his  fists  on  them        please  let  me  out    anyone      he  cried    but  got  no  response      after  a  minute  of  silence    he  let  out  a  sigh  and  sat  down  in  the  fresh  leather  chair  in  the  center  of  the  pod    he  ran  his  fingers  across  the  dashboard    tapping  buttons  and  flicking  switches  with  blurry  eyesight  until  the  pod  began  to  rumble    daniel  clenched  the  armrests  and  pressed  himself  into  the  back  of  his  chair    the  transport  pod  slowly  detached  from  the  space  station    blinking  his  watery  eyes  away    daniel  braced  himself  for  what  was  about  to  come              a  sharp  pain  in  daniel  s  head  and  the  smell  of  smoke  woke  him    ever  so  slightly    he  regained  his  vision    his  head  was  rested  across  the  dashboard  of  the  pod    his  body  barely  hanging  onto  the  edge  of  the  chair    wires  had  fallen  from  the  roof    the  front  window  was  cracked  and  glass  was  scattered  everywhere    once  he  became  aware  of  the  situation    he  wondered  how  he  had  survived    daniel  quickly  realized  that  something  was  dripping  down  his  uncovered  forehead    he  looked  around  the  pod  for  his  helmet  and  found  it  lying  in  the  back    broken  and  splattered  with  thick  red  liquid        he  wiped  his  forehead  and  looked  at  his  hand    he  let  out  a  little  yelp  of  surprise    seeing  that  his  hand  was  completely  drenched  in  blood    daniel  quickly  stood  up  and  leaned  against  the  wall    he  pried  open  the  door  and  squinted  as  the  harsh  sunlight  hit  his  face      earth  wasn  t  how  daniel  imagined  it    the  air  was  thick  and  cloudy    the  sky  was  a  deathly  crimson  color  and  the  sun  looked  huge    bigger  than  it  ever  had  from  the  space  station    daniel  figured  whatever  was  on  the  ground  was  once  grass    but  it  didn  t  look  like  the  grass  in  the  station  s  greenhouse    it  was  shriveled  and  dry  and  the  ground  underneath  it  was  cracked  and  dusty    he  seemed  to  have  landed  in  an  open  field    but  he  could  see  the  outline  of  barren  trees  in  the  distance    everything  seemed  so  different  then  what  daniel  had  seen  in  pictures    but  for  some  reason    he  couldn  t  help  but  smile        he  raised  his  finger  to  tap  the  intercom  button  on  his  suit    but  then  stopped    the  government  sent  him  here  to  die  just  so  they  could  get  some  information  about  earth    they  knew  earth  was  still  dangerous        his  smile  disappeared  quickly  and  he  began  to  slowly  walk  away  from  the  pod  and  towards  the  trees    he  reached  the  top  of  a  small  hill  and  discovered  a  measly  broken  down  hut  on  the  other  side      as  the  sun  scorched  his  skin  and  head  pounding    he  descended  the  hill  and  made  his  way  towards  it        when  daniel  reached  for  the  door  handle    the  door  completely  fell  off  its  hinges  and  into  the  hut    dust  flew  up  from  every  corner  of  the  one  room  house    sending  daniel  into  a  coughing  fit  and  a  sharp  pain  to  his  forehead    inside  the  hut    there  was  a  little  cot  in  the  corner  and  a  desk  beside  it    mold  had  taken  over  almost  every  part  of  the  floor  and  parts  of  the  walls        daniel  stepped  inside  and  sat  down  on  the  old  cot    he  pulled  open  a  few  drawers  in  the  desk  until  he  found  something        a  small    rectangular  object  was  placed  in  the  very  back  of  the  bottom  drawer    he  gently  picked  it  up  and  held  it  close  to  his  face    blinking  sweat  and  blood  off  his  eyelashes    there  was  a  piece  of  tape  stuck  to  it    and  written  on  the  tape  were  the  words    goodbye  to  a  world      he  studied  the  six  buttons  on  the  object    recognizing  the  symbols    he  pressed  the  button  that  had  a  triangle  on  it    assuming  it  was  the    play    button    as  soon  as  he  pressed  it    two  little  wheels  started  to  turn  inside  and  a  voice  came  from  the  device          thank  you    i  ll  say  goodbye  soon      it  was  a  woman    her  voice  sounded  shaky      though  it's  the  end  of  the  world    don  t  blame  yourself        the  woman  stopped  speaking  for  a  moment  to  take  a  strangled  breath          and  if  it's  true    i  will  surround  you  and  give  life  to  a  world  that  s  our  own          the  recording  ended  too  soon    daniel  hugged  it  to  his  chest  and  sighed    he  wondered  how  long  the  device  had  been  sitting  in  the  hut    he  wiped  some  blood  off  of  his  neck  and  pressed  play  again    this  time    the  women  s  voice  was  slightly  staticy        he  listened  to  the  recording  again      then  a  fourth  time      daniel  had  lost  count  of  how  many  times  he  replayed  the  woman  s  voice    when  he  pressed  the  play  button  again    he  could  no  longer  make  out  her  words    but  he  knew  them    the  voice  no  longer  sounded  like  a  woman    it  was  staticy  and  distorted    like  a  robot  s  voice        daniel  tried  to  press  play    but  nothing  happened    he  clenched  the  recorder  in  his  hand  and  stood  up  abruptly    throwing  it  against  the  wall  in  a  fit  of  anger    the  recorder  shattered  into  pieces    shards  of  plastic  flying  across  the  room        he  sighed    falling  to  his  knees    images  of  his  family    friends    and  their  goodbyes  flickered  through  his  mind    he  wanted  to  go  back        but  he  couldn  t        he  brought  his  hands  up  to  his  face  and  clutched  his  head    he  heard  the  sound  of  his  hair  squish  when  he  touched  it    it  was  blood              daniel  collapsed  onto  the  floor    overcome  with  exhaustion    he  decided  to  rest    with  the  woman  s  voice  replaying  in  his  head    his  eyes  closed  as  he  muttered  her  words        thank  you  for  taking  time  in  reading  this      for  a  less  sad  story  lmao  here      hey  guys  we're  a  team  right          no    we're  a  clan        nah    we're  a  family

W2TE0DjdNqI,Ugwc7A8VA8kYx1PxOi94AaABAg,for  a  song  about  losing  someone    there's  something  deeply  relieving  about  listening  to  this  song    maybe  it's  the  fact  that  by  listening  to  it    it's  easier  to  mourn        to  cry  and  let  out  the  pain      because  i  am  saying  all  this    i'll  admit  that  i  have  my  woes  like  anyone  and  everyone    nobody  asked  me  to  type  them  out    just  my  conscience    the  world  i  had  to  say  goodbye  to  was  this  marvelous  individual        someone  i  not  only  fell  for  at  first  sight    but  fell  for  head  over  heels  and  back  around  again    i  was  overwhelmed  by  the  relatively  unconditional  feelings  i  felt  for  them    call  me  a  desperate  simp    i  don't  care    i  don't  feel  love  anymore      and  because  of  this        i  accidentally  overwhelmed  them  by  expressing  myself  the  only  way  i  know  how    with  words    they  weren't  much  of  a  reader    much  to  my  demise    and  my  paragraphs  and  poems  thus  went  overlooked      i  felt  that  i  needed  them  like  i  needed  air  and  sustenance    i  wanted  to  feel  the  full  embrace  of  completion    not  just  the  tickling  warmth  in  my  beating  heart    i'd  sell  my  soul  to  the  devil  for  them    i'd  lay  down  my  life  for  them    i'd  do  anything  for  them        it  pains  me  a  great  deal  to  admit  that  i  still  feel  this  way  for  them    that  i  can't  get  over  them  and  the  tremendous  impact  they've  had  on  my  life    i  soon  had  to  cut  ties  with  immense  reluctance  because  i  stopped  believing  that  i  could  be  patient    because  i  couldn't  be  patient  for  the  answer  of    i  like  you  a  lot  too    i'd  be  happy  to  date  you  to  see  how  it  goes    or    your  emotions  are  getting  out  of  hand    i  don't  know  how  to  feel    but  i  think  it'd  be  better  if  you  go  before  you  hurt  yourself      i  tried  contacting  them  again    at  least  with  the  help  of  a  friend    but  the  person  i  loved  laughed  at  me  and  the  path  i  chose        made  my  tries  at  a  relationship  seem  like  something  they  weren't    ever  since  then    i've  never  felt  more  like  i'm  not  worth  it  in  my  entire  life        i've  felt  the  same  way  to  this  day  and  i  struggle  to  sleep  because  of  it    i  spend  so  much  time  thinking  about  my  actions  and  what  i  could've  done  differently    and  regretting  all  of  it        it  brings  me  to  the  brink  of  tears    so  much  that  i'm  begging  myself  to  cry  and  let  out  the  weakness  and  pain      i  think  of  doing  terrible  things  to  myself  a  lot    but  i  shrug  those  thoughts  off  because  i'm  not  that  kind  of  coward  and  won't  ever  be    the  kind  of  coward  i  know  i  am  now  is  the  kind  who  struggles  to  wake  up  in  the  morning    to  allow  change  into  my  life  and  move  on    to  make  my  life  change    it's  so  hard  to  think  of  what  fun  thing  i  could  do  in  a  day  with  my  parents          you  wanna  go  axe

trying  to  get  a  professional  therapist  to  see  if  i  can  get  some  help    but  i'm  just  as  unsure  of  doing  that  as  i  am  with  allowing  change  into  my  life    i'm  20  years  old  at  the  time  of  making  this  comment    and  i  genuinely  have  stopped  believing  in  myself  and  my  ability  to  find  my  purpose  in  life    it  sucks  being  sad  all  the  time
