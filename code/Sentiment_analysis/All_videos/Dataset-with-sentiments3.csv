trying  to  say    as  a  great  actor  once  said        the  world  ain't  all  sunshine  and  rainbows    it's  a  very  mean  and  nasty  place  and  i  don't  care  how  tough  you  are  it  will  beat  you  to  your  knees  and  keep  you  there  permanently  if  you  let  it        now  you  may  think  that  quote  alone  is  inspirational    but  it  s  not  what  you  read    it  s  what  you  do    you  may  not  be  fine    and  that  s  perfectly  fine  you  may  not  be  ok    and  thats  ok      feel  what  you  feel  but  don  t  let  it  control  your  life    the  doors  of  opportunity  are  unlocked  but  you  ll  never  know  until  you  try  and  open  them  first    you  have  to  be  your  strongest  when  you  are  at  your  weakest    tough  times  dont  last    tough  people  do    success  is  no  accident    it  is  hard  work    perseverance    learning  studying    sacrifice    and  most  of  all    love  what  you  are  doing  or  learning  to  do    the  key  to  success  is  focusing  on  goals  not  obstacles    learn  to  appreciate  what  you  have  before  time  makes  you  appreciate  for  what  you  had    if  the  plan  doesn  t  work    change  the  plan  not  the  goal    if  you  don  t  sacrifice  for  what  you  want    what  you  want  becomes  the  sacrifice    it  takes  nothing  to  join  the  crowd    it  takes  everything  to  stand  alone    don  t  let  yesterday  take  up  too  much  of  today    sometimes  we  are  tested    not  to  find  our  weaknesses    but  to  find  our  strengths    don  t  expect  to  see  a  change  if  you  don  t  make  one    there  are  no  limits  to  what  you  can  accomplish      except  the  limits  you  place  in  your  own  thinking    if  you  think  it  s  hard  and  you    can  t  do  it    don  t  turn  down  opportunities    because  every  decision  you  make  comes  down  to  one  moment    in  the  middle  of  difficulty  lies  opportunity    this  is  for  everyone  who  thinks  the're  nothing    people  in  this  world  are  going  to  fool  you  disappoint  you  turn  their  back  on  you  the  closest  around  you  are  going  to  give  up  on  you  and  when  shit  hit  the  fan  everybody  is  gonna  run  you  gonna  look  around  and  you  will  be  all  alone    i  know  what  you're  going  through    god  will  never  leave  you  nor  forsake  you  and  that  is  all  you  need  there's  a  power  inside  of  you  that  you  can  only  discover  when  you  are  truly  alone  just  as  the  waves  on  a  beach  shore  come  in  and  out  people  will  do  the  same  relationships  are  like  music  and  you  should  never  make  music  with  anybody  who  doesn't  understand    appreciate  and  value  your  lyrics    sometimes    you  just  got  to  let  these  people  go  you  got  to  know  your  worth    you  got  to  stop  chasing  people  who  don't  appreciate  you    sometimes  in  this  life  you  gotta  remind  the  world  just  who  you  are    and  you  don't  do  this  by  telling  them  with  your  mouth    you  tell  them  with  your  actions    you  take  your  actions    don't  let  the  world  convince  you  that  you're  nobody    you're  somebody  who  just  don't  know  it  yet    you  haven  t  failed  100  times    you  have  successfully  found  100  ways  that  didn  t  work    no  one  is  a

 this  very  second    every  second  more  then  billions  of  people  leave  this  world    but  you  are  still  here  aren  t  you        look  at  how  much  you  ve  been  threw  and  you  re  still  here    that  means  that  god  still  has  plans  for  you    please  don  t  give  up    please  don  t  hurt  yourself    don  t  do  suicide    things  will  get  better  if  you  believe  in  it    please  don  t  give  up    look  at  how  far  you  made  it    if  there  are  billions  of  people  dying  every  second    and  you  are  still  alive    its  for  a  purpose    i  m  a  teenage  girl  who  has  a    perfect    life    or  that  s  what  others  think    you  see    i  am  very  nice  to  everyone    and  no  matter  what  they  have  done  in  their  life    bad  or  very  bad    no  matter  what  mistake  or  how  many  mistakes  they  made    i  will  stick  up  for  them  and  be  supportive    i  ve  always  been  there  for  everyone    i  support  them  when  they  need  it    i  write  paragraphs  of  supporting  and  loving  words    but  when  i  need  someone  there  for  me    all  i  get  is    mood    or    poor  girl    or    i  hope  it  gets  better    and  that  s  it    not  even  a  single  paragraph    just  a  short  phrase    now  that  s  only  one  problem    another  one  is  that  i  m  very  shy    well  that  s  what  people  think    i  used  to  be  a  very  outgoing  girl    i  would  always  talk  about  how  my  day  was    i  would  always  be  talking  normally  with  people    but  then  it  came  to  the  point  where  a  lot  of  people  told  me  that  i  was    too  loud    and  i  am  a  very  sensitive  person  and  at  first  i  just  said    oh    sorry    and  i  would  talk  more  quiet    but  eventually  more  people  told  me  that  i  was  talking    too  loud    and  so  that  leads  me  to  not  talking  at  all    which  leads  me  to  being  without  friends  bc  apparently  i  am    too  quiet    and  i  barely  talk    we  went  to  a  teens  winter  camp    and  everyone  was  just  leaving  me  out    whenever  they  would  go  somewhere    nobody  would  tell  me  and  then  next  thing  you  know    i  was  alone    and  my  older  sister  is  the  best  sister  i  can  ask  for    she  came  up  to  my  cousin  and  asked  why  they  left  me  out    and  what  she  said  was      it  s  her  fault  she  never  talks      and  do  you  know  what        she  was  the  one  that  told  me  i  was  talking    too  loud    to  the  point  i  never  talk    now  the  next  thing    now  that  i  don  t  talk  much    i  don  t  have  any  friends    and  when  i  meet  a  new  person  that  actually  talks  with  me  and  likes  to  hang  out  with  me    i  get  too  excited  and  eventually  open  up  too  much  and  then  i  talk  too  much    and  do  you  know  what  that  leads  to      them  saying  that  i  m  annoying    and  that  made  me  even  worse    so  now  i  don  t  talk  at  all    now    the  same  cousin  that  told  me  i  was    too  loud    and  then      it  s  not  my  fault  she  doesn  t  talk      has  a  family  that  has  five  beautiful  girls    and  guess  what      my  parents  expect  me  and  my  siblings  to  be  like  them    but  what  they  don  t  know    are  their  true  colors    they  are  fake    they  judge  everyone    and  more    and  everyone  sees  them  as    perfect      now  i  still  love  them  bc  they  are  my  family    but  if  anyone  actually  even  read  this    moving  on  to  my  uncle    all  i  can  say  is  that  i  hate  him  but  i  don  t  want  to    and  if  you  re  wondering  why  i  hate  my  uncle      it  s  because  he  makes  jokes  about  me  being  fat    i  am  kind  of  a  big  girl    and  when  he  makes  those  jokes  i  tell  myself  that    it  s  just  a  joke      but  it  got  to  the  point  where  even  my  sister  couldn  t  handle  it  and  said  that  it  s  going  way  too  far    so  she  told  my  mom  that  he  has  been  making  jokes  about  me  being    big    for  quite  a  while  now  and  that  it  s  going  too  far    and  what  does  my  mom  say    she  says  that  i  m  being  too  dramatic  and  that  its  just  a  joke    now  don  t  get  me  wrong    my  mom  is  the  best  mom  i  could  ever  have    but  she  just  doesn  t  see  it  because  that  s  her  sister  husband    so  we  went  to  camp  for  a  week  with  my  uncles  family    and  one  day  when  we  went  swimming    i  put  my  red  bathing  suit  on    and  i  had  to  constantly  pull  it  up  because  my  cherries  would  show    so  i  went  to  make  sand  castles  with  my  little  sister  and  my  little  cousin    we  were  playing  and  building  and  i  had  to  bend  over  to  fix  the  castle  on  the  other  side    all  i  heard  was  my  aunt  saying    where  are  you  looking    or    stop  looking  there    i  don  t  really  remember    but  then  she  says    hey  corina    pull  up  your  bathing  suit  top      and  i  pulled  it  up  and  then  i  looked  up  and  what  did  i  see      my  uncle  laughing    now  a  couple  days  later  when  we  were  leaving    we  put  everything  in  the  car    and  there  was  a  lot  of  stuff  since  we  went  there  for  a  week    and  so  my  dad  told  me  to  sit  in  the  back  of  the  car  because  my  brother  gets  car  sick  very  easily  and  it  was  going  to  be  a  3  hour  drive    so  i  sat  in  the  back  of  the  care  and  there  wasn  t  a  lot  of  space    i  was  next  to  the  window  and  then  there  was  a  bunch  of  stuff  right  next  to  me    while  my  parents  went  to  take  some  more  stuff      btw  it  s  night    my  uncle  flashes  a  flashlight  on  me  through  the  window  and  says    are  you  going  to  make  it  home      and  then  starts  laughing    i  then  start  crying  because  i  couldn  t  handle  it  anymore  and  so  that  s  when  my  sister  told  me  mom    and  that  s  when  she  said  that  i  was  overreacting    i  have  a  lot  of  problems  in  my  life    but  i  don  t  give  up    instead  i  write  these  paragraphs  to  people  who  are  having  issues    some  have  a  few  issues    and  some  have  a  lot  of  big  issues  in  their  life    and  i  forget  about  all  of  my  problems  and  i  help  others    and  it  helps  me      now  to  whoever  reading  this    if  you  are  having  issues  in  your  life  right  now    you  are  not

qVdPh2cBTN0,UgyvNjzNvulNaQSe4bV4AaABAg,this  song  reminded    me  of  my  younger  self    yesterday  i  was  looking  at  pictures  when  i  was  little    i  could  see  how  happy  and  free  i  was    i  didn't  even  know  what  depression    hatred  meant    i  didn't  even  think  about  my  look    because  then  every  problem  was  small  for  me    i  never  wondered  what  i  would  be  like  when  i  grew  up    but  i  least  expected  to  be  like  i  am  today    i  didn't  think  that  the  happy  child  in  the  picture  would  be  depressed  today      would  want  to  take  her  own  life  at  a  young  age    i'm  sorry  that  i  became  a  completely  different  person      i  can't  help  myself  at  all    but  i  still  like  to  help  others    because  that  makes  me  feel  better  knowing  that  i  have  helped  someone    i  m  not  living  anymore    i  m  hardly  even  surviving    unlike  today's  generation    i  feel  very  more  mature    maybe  it's  because  of  depression    someone  said  that  people  with  depression  usually  grow  up  faster    the  problem  is  that  my  parents  don't  care  about  me  and  my  sisters  at  all    they  just  think  about  their  problems    and  my  sisters    they  take  depression  and  anxiety  as  a  joke          what  would  it  mean  to  me  to  tell  them  how  i  feel          they  would  probably  make  fun  of  me    its  really  sad    that  no  one  in  your  life  suspects  that  anything  is  going  on    i  also  had  a  friend  i  knew  for  9  years    but  she  soon  replaced  me  with  someone  else    it  was  very  difficult  for  me    because  i  was  used    since  i  was  a  child    to  always  be  with  her    and  i  didn't  go  anywhere  without  her    which  caused  me  anxiety  today    i  have  no  reason  to  continue  living    i  am  tired  of  everything    of  school    of  people  who  hurt  and  harass  me  all  the  time    of  my  parents  who  constantly  quarrel  and  who  even  find  it  difficult  to  take  me  to  the  doctor  when  i  am  sick  so  they  don  t  have  to  spend  money  on  me    i  can  no  longer  endure    i  would  like  to  have  someone  who  would  understand  me    but  i  m  all  alone  doing  everything  by  myself    three  months  ago  my  grandparents  both  died  in  one  week    which  broke  me  and  exhausted  me  a  lot    i  couldn't  believe  it  had  happened    after  that    everything  started  to  get  worse    i'm  afraid  to  do  something  to  myself    but  i  can't  live  this  life  anymore    it  is  hard  to  live  every  day  with  such  thoughts  and  such  sadness  in  your  head    depression  is  killing  me    i  don't  know  how  much  longer  i  will  last    this  song  is  definitely  one  of  the  most  emotional  song  i  ve  ever  listened  to    i  can  find  myself  in  it    i'm  sorry  that  happy  little  me  without  a  single  problem  disappeared        today  s  people  would  do  anything  just  to  hurt  you    i  am  sorry  that  some  people  think  that  they  have  to  look  as  beautiful  as  celebrities  in  order  for  someone  to  accept  them    they  have  allowed  their  insecurities  to  take  over  who  they  used  to  be    i  am  sorry  that  they  are  ashamed  of  their  faces  and  bodies    yet  all  this  is  given  by  god    why  would  he  make  you  like  that      i  think  he  sees  you  so  perfectly      i  understand    it's  very  difficult  isn't  it          i  lock  myself  in  the  room  and  only  come  out  when  i  absolutely  have  to    which  is  usually  for  dinner    i  no  longer  have  the  motivation  to  do  anything    my  head  starts  spinning  and  i  can't  take  it  anymore,1019,-0.024676406926406932,0,song reminded younger self yesterday looking pictures little could see happy free n't even know depression hatred meant n't even think look every problem

qVdPh2cBTN0,UgxBO4ShjRU2K-StcIR4AaABAg,i  love  how  this  song  has  many  different  views  and  meanings    for  some  people  it  may  mean  a  destruction  of  one  self    pretending  to  be  someone  else  when  you  are  not    that  feeling  when  you  think  you're  the  only  one  who  knows  yourself  very  well  that  everyone  you  know  wouldn't  understand  you    but  surprise  you're  too  messed  up  that  even  you  don't  know  the  real  you        but  i  see  a  story  in  this  song    it's  like  the  singer  is  talking  to  a  loved  one  who  has  a  mental  illness  that  drastically  changes  that  person    which  explains  the  biology  ness  of  this  video  is  that  even  a  word    thus  changing  the  person  they  know  in  the  past  to  the  person  in  the  present  who  is  messed  up    yea  past  and  present  may  look  the  same    but  they're  somebody  else  now      and  the  meaning  might  be  also  less  connected  to  science  most  likely    it's  like  this  song  is  preferring  to  a  friend  that  you  have  lost  because  he  or  she  has  changed  his  personality  and  the  friendship  cannot  be  salvaged  anymore  because  of  the  180  degree  turn  in  how  that  friend  treated  you      there  are  many  more  significance  hidden  in  this  song  which  is  why  this  is  one  of  my  favorites    deep  and  relatable  af,3,0.1121031746031746,1,love song many different views meanings people may mean destruction one self pretending someone else feeling think 're one knows well everyone know would n't understand surprise 're messed even n't know real see story song 's like singer talking loved one mental illness drastically changes person explains biology ness video even word thus changing person know past person present messed yea past present may look 're somebody else meaning might also less connected science likely 's like song preferring friend lost changed personality friendship salvaged anymore 180 degree turn friend treated many significance hidden song one favorites deep relatable af
