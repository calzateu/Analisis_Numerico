It brought me back to life just in time to face the typhoon that the next 4 years would be. Today, I'm listening again and I'm looking back at how little I had to complain about back then and how much I've grown since. Thank god for the pain and the hard times because they pushed me almost to suicide and a strange thing happened to me teetering on that edge. My soul found it's way home, I realized that I'm not one of those people, if I were then I'd surely be dead by now, I can't give up so I should stop wasting time. Every day is a miracle to behold, every moment an opportunity, the pain has shaped me like water shapes stone and it turns out that something remarkable was underneath the surface this whole time. People die and time marches on, people suffer and the sun still rises and sets, good times are things that we make from within and share and those are the memories that we get to keep. Love life, face fear and know that it's supposed to be hard, nature doesn't care about what you or I think of as fairness anymore than a tornado searches it's conscience before plowing into a populated neighborhood. If you want to be healthy then you have to discipline yourself, if you want to be happy then you have to grab life by the balls and get after what you want. Don't make my mistake and think that you are better than you are at anything, that's an ego and a false sense of security is all that it provides, every pursuit requires an investment of time and effort and you have to really want it. I'm a decent writer because I love writing enough to do it every day in one form or another, the same is true for musicians and artists, they do what they love, they get after it and they create remarkable things like this song that speaks so deeply to an ineffable part of my being.\",\n",
