MwpMEbgC7DA,UgwJx3b6TwCrO-to7j14AaABAg,My  girlfriend  of  four  years  broke  up  with  me  a  couple  of  months  ago    back  in  January    2019      and  I  was  completely  devastated  for  around  two  months    I  cried  for  at  least  an  hour    every  single  day    throughout  the  first  month    She  was  everything  I  had  in  my  life        I  got  a  lot  of  experience  through  this  breakup    though      and  I  got  a  chance  to  truly  feel  emotions  like  never  before    several  times    I  even  had  to  vomit    when  I  got  very  sad        But  now    over  two  months  later    I  feel  simply  nothing    Just  nothing  at  all    is  the  best  way  to  describe  it    No  pain    no  anger    no  sorrow    no  happiness    nothing    Perhaps  due  to  my  mind  and  heart  being  exhausted  from  the  overly  emotional  period  I've  endured    And  what  worries  me  now    is  that  I  am  not  going  to  be  able  to  fall  in  love  again      hence  why  I  relate  SO  much  to  this  song      I  found  the  love  of  my  life    I  loved  everything  about  her      and  I  lost  her    I  am  not  sure  if  I'm  able  to  fall  in  love  like  that    again    I  have  trust  issues    as  the  main  reason  to  our  breakup  was  due  to  her  not  telling  me  about  her  thoughts  and  emotions    and  she  pretty  much  cheated  on  me  as  well      and  I  feel  like  my  mind  and  or  heart  won't  let  me  go  through  all  the  pain  again    if  things  won't  work  out  with  the  coming  partners

MwpMEbgC7DA,UgxfoCg5zQog6hGqpGN4AaABAg,I  love  this  song    it  shows  how  someone  can  be  damaged  with  love    to  the  point  that  you  feel  u  can't  love  anymore    at  least  not  as  much  as  u  used  to    U  want  to  give  everything  to  someone  but  u  are  too  hurt  because  u  gave  too  much  to  the  wrong  person    That  happens  alot  with  people  that  start  a  relationship  when  they  aren't  healed  yet    so    even  tho  u  love  someone    don't  start  a  relationship  when  u  are  not  ready  for  it    it  can  destroy  u  and  the  person  u  love
